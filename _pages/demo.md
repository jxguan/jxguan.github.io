Please find below a video of my teaching demonstration.

The topic is the **Stable Matching** problem, which I cover in the first lecture of my Basic Algorithms course. This topic serves as an accessible example of how algorithms are designed to solve real-world problems while minimizing the use of mathematical notations and proofs, as this is usually students' first course in theoretical computer science.
