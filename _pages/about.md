I am a faculty fellow at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu), hosted by [Marshall Ball](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mmb586/index.html) and [Yevgeniy Dodis](https://cs.nyu.edu/~dodis).

My research focuses on exploring the space-constrained aspects of cryptography, including but not limited to the Bounded Storage Model, incompressible cryptography, space lower bounds, etc., though I am broadly interested in other topics in cryptography and theoretical computer science in general.

I earned my PhD from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mark Zhandry](https://mzhandry.github.io). I graduated with a B.S. with Honors and a M.S. from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), with [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo) as my advisor.

When I'm not working, I mostly enjoy photography, [theater](https://www.cellunova.org), and cooking.
