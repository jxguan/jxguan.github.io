I am an Applied Cryptographer at [Zellic](https://www.zellic.io), where I audit and conduct research across a wide range of advanced cryptographic systems.

My academic research focuses on **the space aspects of cryptography**, exploring scenarios where space is a limited resource for either adversaries or honest users. This includes work on the Bounded Storage Model, incompressible cryptography, streaming functional encryption, and space lower bounds. I am also broadly interested in other topics in theoretical and applied cryptography in general.

Previously, I was an Assistant Professor / Faculty Fellow at [New York University](https://cs.nyu.edu), hosted by [Marshall Ball](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mmb586/index.html) and [Yevgeniy Dodis](https://cs.nyu.edu/~dodis). I earned my PhD from [Princeton University](https://cs.princeton.edu), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mark Zhandry](https://mzhandry.github.io). I graduated with a B.S. with Honors and a M.S. from [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu), with [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo) as my advisor.

When I'm not working, I mostly enjoy photography, [theater](https://www.cellunova.org), and cooking.
